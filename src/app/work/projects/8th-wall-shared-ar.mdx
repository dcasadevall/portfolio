## Overview

This project focused on bridging 8thwall's web-based AR capabilities with Niantic's robust multiplayer backend services. 
The framework provides developers with both low-level JavaScript APIs for direct multiplayer functionality and high-level 
A-Frame components for rapid AR experience development. The result is a comprehensive toolkit that enables creators to 
build sophisticated multiplayer AR experiences directly in the browser, demonstrated through the creation of "Hot Pot Hop," 
a competitive multiplayer AR game.

## Key Features

- **Low-Level JavaScript API**: Created a foundational API layer for room management and peer-to-peer communication without A-Frame dependencies.
- **Custom A-Frame Extensions**: Developed specialized components including a lobby system with customizable UI and a networking layer for state synchronization.
- **Client Interpolation**: Implemented smooth object movement and state updates across multiple clients using advanced interpolation techniques.
- **Sample Implementation**: Created "Hot Pot Hop," a multiplayer AR game showcasing state propagation, client prediction, and race condition handling.

## Technologies Used

- **8thwall Web Editor**: For AR scene creation and management.
- **A-Frame**: For WebXR implementation and 3D scene composition.
- **JavaScript**: For core API development and networking logic.
- **Niantic Multiplayer Services**: For backend room management and real-time communication.
- **WebSocket**: For real-time data synchronization between clients.
- **React**: For UI components and lobby system implementation.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was creating a framework that balanced simplicity with power, making it accessible to developers while 
maintaining the sophisticated features needed for multiplayer AR. Implementing client prediction and handling race conditions 
in a web environment required careful consideration of network latency and state management. The project also demanded 
creating intuitive APIs that could abstract the complexity of multiplayer synchronization while giving developers the 
flexibility they need.

## Outcome

The framework successfully enables developers to create multiplayer AR experiences using familiar web technologies. The 
Hot Pot Hop demo proves the framework's capabilities in handling real-time multiplayer interactions, state synchronization, 
and smooth client interpolation. The project demonstrates how web-based AR can deliver compelling multiplayer experiences 
without requiring native app installation, making AR more accessible to both developers and end-users.
